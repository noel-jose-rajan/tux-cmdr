# Simple Terminal Game in C

A fun and lightweight terminal-based game written in C. Move your character around the box using **WASD** keys and enjoy some classic console action!

---

## Features

- Real-time keyboard input without needing to press Enter
- Responsive character movement inside a bordered box
- Clean, minimalistic terminal interface
- Cross-platform compatible (works on Linux/macOS; Windows support can be added)

---

## How to Play

- Use **W** to move **up**
- Use **A** to move **left**
- Use **S** to move **down**
- Use **D** to move **right**
- Press **Q** to quit the game

Your goal is to move the character (represented by `*`) freely within the box boundary.
